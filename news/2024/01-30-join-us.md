The Ojos Project is looking for people to join our team! We are a research
project under UC Irvine Professor Mark S. Baldwin's Undergraduate Research Lab.
Join us to create a different way technology can help individuals in palliative
care and hospice!

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Purpose

Hospice patients are often immobile and slowly lose their independence,
relying on the people around them to take care of them. It is a stressful
experience wanting to be there with your loved one, but have other
responsibilities, such as work. This can become dangerous if the caregiver
forgets critical information about the patient's care, loses track of how often
medication was taken, or forgets to report the patient's level of comfort.

The purpose of the Ojos Project is to increase the patient's independence while
ensuring their caregivers are on the same page, all with a single kiosk-like
device.

## üõ†Ô∏è What are we doing?

At the Ojos Project, we're researching, developing, and building.

We're researching the needs of hospice patients, caregivers, and nurses by
reading academic articles and conducting interviews.

We're developing open-source software based on our research to expand access of
quality hospice software using [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/), Linux, and
other accessibility software.

We're building a device based on our software that will improve the quality of
care your loved one gets. We're using [Raspberry Pis](https://raspberrypi.com/)
to physically build the device.

All of our software will be for the good of those in need, and will be 100% free
and open-source.

## üë∑ Member Responsibilities

Other member responsibilities depend heavily on the team they're in. The URL
Group has three teams:

- [Developers team](https://github.com/ojosproject/iris/tree/main/docs)
  - Software design
  - Learning Rust
  - Developing the software
  - Implement external accessibility software
- [Engineering team](https://github.com/ojosproject/website/blob/cc24069ca979c0aa9ddd5ff78b0360d95daa1a1d/docs/url/engineering/README.md)
  - Product design research
  - Electrical engineering
  - Computer aided design
  - Additive manufacturing
  - Raspberry Pi to build the device
- [Research team](https://github.com/ojosproject/website/blob/cc24069ca979c0aa9ddd5ff78b0360d95daa1a1d/docs/url/research/README.md)
  - Conduct interviews
  - Read research articles and take notes
  - Explain your research to the other teams

Individuals who are not enrolled in IN4MATX 199 may join and leave the project
however they'd like.
Please read the Informatics 199 Acknowledgment.

## üôã How you can help

We're looking for individuals who are curious about software, engineering, and
hospice care.

More specifically, we're looking for

- People to read/take notes of hospice-related academic articles
- A Research team lead
- Software developers

This is a learning experience for everyone, so if you don't know how to do some
of the things in this post, please know we may just be in a similar boat! üõ∂
