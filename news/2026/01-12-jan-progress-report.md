# Jan. 2026 Progress Report

![Ojos Project progress report banner](@site/static/images/blog-progress-report.png)

## Welcome to a new year!

We acknowledge it’s been quiet for the second half of 2025, but that does not
mean we haven’t been cooking on some amazing things to show you! From new icons
to a new direction for the Palliaview project, we have a lot to share. :)

## A fresh new look

[Jesse David](https://jessedavid.design/) designed beautiful new icons to replace
the placeholders we’ve had on Iris! With brand new page icons and an app icon,
we’re giving Iris a fresh new look! Take a look below:

Iris has been in development for almost two years, so we believe it's time to
make the program look professional. Going forward, Iris' interface will start to
promote a more polished look, starting with these amazing icons.

## Welcoming our new members

Nearing the end of our Spring quarter of last year, we’ve had to say goodbye to
some members and introduce new ones. We’d like to give a warm welcome to
**Jacky Laraher** and **Annabel Wang**. They’ve been doing research for the
project as well as working on various tasks. Welcome to the team!

We’d also like to congratulate the team members that have graduated in Spring.
Congratulations to Ayush J., Mai P., and Carlos V.! We’d also like to thank Helen for her
wonderful contributions to the project and wish her luck studying abroad. :)

## Research Experience Fellowship 2025

Once again, members at the Undergraduate Research Lab applied for the Research
Experience Fellowship, and we won! The team will get funding for the project, as
well as officially gain the title of Research Fellows. Congratulations to Joseph,
Jason, Meadow, Annabel, and Jacky!

This marks the third year in a row that the lab wins this award.

## A path for Palliaview

The original idea for Palliaview was to flash Linux onto an embedded device with
Iris pre-installed. However, thanks to Jason Martin’s research, we’ve come to
the decision to instead use AndroidOS via the
[Android Open Source Project](https://source.android.com/) (AOSP) as the
operating system for Palliaview as it strikes a balance between ease of setup
and runtime/space efficiency.

Thanks to [Tauri 2.0](https://tauri.app/blog/tauri-20/), we have the ability to
seamlessly support not only the three major desktop operating systems, but also
iOS and Android, allowing a single UI to function across all of Iris’ different
versions. Developers have been focusing on Palliaview-specific
features, such as eye-tracking and motion detection, which will be tested and
fully integrated this upcoming Winter quarter.

## Internal restructuring

Since many of our founding members have graduated, we’ve had to change how we
work. Some of the graduated members still contribute to the project as open
source contributors as the Iris team, while those still in school contribute as
the Undergraduate Research Lab. As more students graduate, more may become open
source contributors.

The Undergraduate Research Lab is the main team working with the current Iris
source code as they’re porting it to Android and tailoring it to Palliaview. The
Iris team, on the other hand, will refine existing features.
