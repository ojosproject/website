# Iris Logo Contest: "Love is collaborative"

![Love is Collaborative header](@site/static/images/love-is-collaborative.png)

## 💡 Background

Iris is a program developed by the Ojos Project at [UC Irvine](https://uci.edu/)
to help caregivers/families better manage
caregiving tasks. If you've ever been a caregiver for a loved one, you know how
overwhelming it can be to keep track of your loved one's care. Iris is meant to
help you keep track of all care-related tasks in an efficient and
easy-to-understand way.

As we approach our first public release, we came to realize something critical
— we don't have a logo! This is where you come in. 👀

## 🎨 Theme

**Love is collaborative.**

When it comes to caring for a loved one, it isn't always a one-person effort.
It includes family, nursing staff, and more to be able to provide the best
possible care for someone. In honor of this, your logo should be inspired by
this theme.
