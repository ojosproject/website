# Introducing Iris v0

Ojos Project is proud to announce the release of Iris v0.1.0, the first
iteration of our all-in-one caregiver tool!

## Inspiration for Iris

Many of us in Ojos Project have experienced having to take care of a family
member with a serious illness. We saw first-hand the limits of technology in the
hospice space, and came together to build modern tools for not just the hospice
space, but the palliative care space as a whole.

Iris' development is also inspired by the literary analysis conducted by Ojos
Project, as well as the various interviews we've conducted with caregivers and
healthcare professionals. Their input have us incredible insight into the
stress caregivers and families face.

## Key features

### Summary

Iris turns your device into a full fledged care management system, providing
all the essentials you need when caring for a loved one. Not only does it help
by keeping everything in one place, it includes:

- üíä **Medication management** - A simple to navigate interface to manage and
  log taken medication
- üìà **Patient Reported Outcome tracking** - A questionnaire for patients to
  keep track of their quality of care
- üìù **Care instructions documentation** - Leave notes for all caregivers to
  stay on the same page
- üìπÔ∏è **Video monitoring** - Record your patient while you're away to ensure
  they're getting the best possible quality (Windows/macOS only)
- üë• **Contacts** - A list of contacts for nurses and caregivers to keep in
  contact

### Local-first approach

The kind of data that Iris tracks is can be very private, and we take that
responsibility very seriously. Iris takes a local-first approach to data,
meaning that if we can avoid keeping data the cloud, we will.

The majority of Iris data is kept locally on-device. No internet service
required.

### A commitment to open source

The Iris software is licensed under the GNU GPLv3.

We released Iris under this license to ensure that our software lives to benefit
people and encourage open collaboration between the world's developers.

For the tinkerers, Iris' source code is available
[on Github](https://github.com/ojosproject/iris/) for you to play with and
build from source.
