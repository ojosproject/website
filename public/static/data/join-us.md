# Join the Ojos Project

## ❤️ Purpose

Hospice patients are often immobile and slowly lose their independence, relying on the people around them to take care of them. It's difficult to help someone in this position when we often have other responsibilities, such as work.

During this moment, caregivers often have a lot on their mind. This can become dangerous if the caregiver forgets critical information about the patient's care, loses track of how often medication was taken, or forgets to report the patient's level of comfort.

The purpose of the Ojos Project is to increase patient independence by providing a kiosk-like assistant and to make sure all caregivers are on the same page by ensuring all information on the kiosk is up to date and synchronized with their personal devices.

## 🛠️ What are we doing?

We're researching the needs of hospice patients and caregivers to provide them with an easier way for caregivers to manage their loved one's care, while also allowing the patient as much independence as they would like.

Our current plan is to use tools such as the [Raspberry Pi OS](https://www.raspberrypi.com/software/) to build this system while experimenting with Linux Window Managers such as the [awesome window manager](https://awesomewm.org/). This may also include programming languages such as [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) and [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

All of our software will be for the good of those in need, and will be 100% free and open-source.

## 👷 Member Responsibilities

Considering we're being graded for this project, there will be responsibilities for this project. At the very minimum, the responsibilities include:
