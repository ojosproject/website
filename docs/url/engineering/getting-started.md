will be used throughout the kiosk. The link takes you to the download link to
install on your computer operating system. We can run it as a virtual machine to
iterate the code.

[SolidWorks](https://laptops.eng.uci.edu/engineering-software/solidworks-student-engineering-kit-for-hssoe-students)
is a vital 3D software we will use to virtual design our kiosk. This link will
take you to download the software using UCI student engineering kit.
Additionally, fo member who may not have a powerful enough laptop or are not

browser CAD software that is free for students.
