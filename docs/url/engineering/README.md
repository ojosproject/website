    The Engineering team of the Ojos Project is in charge of product development
    and research of the kiosk. They will interact with Raspberry Pi, Commuter
    Aided Design, Additive Manufacturing, etc. They will contribute to the code
    process if needed.

Engineering Team
==================

Welcome to the Engineering Team at the Ojos Project. We are in charge of design
and manufacturing of the physical device used by our users. We will utilize the
research given by the research team in the consideration of our design.
Responsibilities include digital design and recording of version iteration.
Additionally, we help in contribution of the code that will be installed on the
kiosk.

Responsibilities
----------------

At the moment there are 3 teams working under the project: the Developers team,
the Engineering team, and the Research teams.

As a part of the Engineering Team we utilize the research given to us by the
Research team to determine constraints in the designs. Furthermore, any
information or questions that are needed to be review are passed to the Research
Team to be ascertained.

E.g Design features that can make our device AOTA Complaint? What materials should be avoided for
healthcare use?

The engineering team will consult with the Developers team on the software of
the device to ensure that they can request features be implemented in the
physical construction. E.g Camera for video use. It also allows the engineering
team to make contributions to the software use, i.e we will suggest programs the
device will need to be able to accomplish such as voice recognition and AI
implementation.
