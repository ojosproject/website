# Welcome to the Ojos Project

We're pleased that you decided to join us. There's a few things we need you to
do to get started. ✨

## About the Ojos Project

Before we get you set up to work with us, read this section to learn more about
the Ojos Project as well as who we are. Otherwise, if you just want to get
setup, [you can go to the setup section](#setup).

### Background

Carlos Valdez is an Informatics undergraduate at the University of California,
Irvine. In July 2022, Carlos' grandma was placed in hospice because her cancer
was too advanced. Since this was during the summer, Carlos spent most of his
time taking care of her. While his mom and grandpa were working, he'd give her
medications, food, and overall ensure she was okay. Once his grandpa would come
home from work, he'd take over the care. This was the cycle for most weekdays
until August 17 when she had passed away. During this time, he had witnessed
critical shortcomings in hospice. Miscommunication between caregivers and
difficulty in communicating with hospice nurses were a big issue. In this
project, Carlos is the lead of the [Developers team](/url/developers/).

Professor Mark Baldwin is a professor at UCI in the department of Informatics.
He has a background in accessibility and assistive technologies and pursued a
Ph.D. to make an impact in this field. During the summer of 2023, Carlos had
emailed Professor Mark Baldwin about potential research opportunities. During
this time, the professor was about to take research proposals for the
Undergraduate Research Lab, so it was perfect timing for both parties.
[Carlos submitted this proposal](/url/proposal/) to the professor, and after a
few more emails and a meeting, we got to work on the (soon to be named) Ojos
Project. In this project, Professor Baldwin is our research advisor and faculty
mentor.

<!-- todo: Joseph should probably add a section here for himself since he was part of Ojos for just about the same time. -->

Since the Ojos Project started in October 2023, many more members have joined.

### What is hospice care?

Hospice care is a type of care that focuses on a person's comfort as they're
approaching the end of their life. People are usually placed in hospice care if
their illness cannot be cured.

Palliative care, on the other hand, may be similar to hospice care, however,
people undergoing palliative care are still receiving treatment for their
serious illness.

You can learn more about both types of care from
[this article from the National Institute of Health](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/hospice-and-palliative-care/what-are-palliative-care-and-hospice-care).

### Problems we identified

Although hospice and palliative care focus on a patient's comfort, there's some
aspects to it that can be improved. Through personal experiences and interviews
we've conducted, we discovered aspects of palliative care that can be improved.

Some of the problems we've identified are:

- Miscommunication between caregivers
- Caregivers not being able to be there due to work or financial reasons
- Patients running the risk of being mistreated by hospice nurses
- Patients forgetting to report their discomfort to nurses
- ... and more

### Our solutions

Technology can't fix everything, but we can try.

The goal of this project is to develop a device with our open-source software
that does the following:

- Document medications/care instructions
- Providing financial resources to caregivers
- Video monitoring the patient-nurse interactions to hold nurses accountable
- Ensuring we document Patient Recorded Outcomes (PROs)
- ... and more

We're trying to develop two solutions: Iris, the open-source software that can
do all of the above and be installable on any Linux distribution, and
Palliview, a device that uses our software to provide a "plug and play"
experience.

:::tip

If you want to get a deeper understanding of the solutions we came up with, you
can view our
[internal interview notes here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1eIlEgCuRF6o4AtZqr3XAkX4-Ur-Y1uDr).
These are notes from caregivers and healthcare professionals we've interviewed.

We also have our
[Requirements document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EJlghYqhiPrZsjPUHxxG_WeHkHulPB4a-HF8fL7QsCs/).
A requirements document has all of the features our software should include, as
well as shareholder concerns. It may be worth giving this document a read.

We're also actively working
[C4 Model diagrams](/url/developers/design/c4-model/), which visually depicts
the software architecture of Iris.

## Setup

Now that you have a general background of the Ojos Project, let's get you set
up!

### Understand the Structure

The Ojos Project runs under a "group, team, member" structure. You are
participating in the URL Group. [Read the policies about that here if
you're interested](/policies/structure/).

In short, a group in the Ojos Project works on a project. A team in a group
works on a specific part of that project, such as development or engineering. A
member is someone who is a member of a team.

The URL Group has two teams: [Developers](/url/developers/) and
[Engineering](/url/engineering/).

Both groups and teams have leads.

| Group/Team       | Lead          |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| URL Group        | Carlos Valdez |
| Developers team  | Carlos Valdez |
| Engineering team | Joseph Sweatt |

As a member, you report to your team lead, and team leads report to the group
lead.

### Figure out your commitment

Some students in this research project are enrolled in IN4MATX 199 at UCI,
**but new members are not able to enroll**. Read the
[IN4MATX 199 Acknowledgement](/policies/inf199-acknowledgement) to learn more.

If you are not enrolled in IN4MATX 199, you may join and leave the project as
you'd like, with limits. The limits are: 1) Your attendance must be documented,
and 2) If you go AWOL for 2 weeks, we will assume you dropped the project. Read
[our attendance policies](/policies/url-lab-attendance/) to learn more.

### Add meetings to your calendar

We meet on a regular basis. This is our meeting times for the 2024 Spring
quarter:

| Team             | Meeting              | Location | Description         |
| ---------------- | -------------------- | -------- | ------------------- |
| Developers Team  | Wed/Th @ **1pm**-3pm | DBH 5089 | Work on the project |
| Engineering Team | Wed/Th @ **1pm**-3pm | DBH 5089 | Work on the project |

:::note

If you are enrolled in IN4MATX 199, you must show up on Thursday earlier at 12pm
to meet with our research advisor,
[Dr. Mark S. Baldwin](https://www.informatics.uci.edu/explore/faculty-profiles/mark-baldwin/).

We discuss our progress and the overall direction of where the project is
heading.

### Join our Google Drive

We have an
[internal Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nsghXOEXTWsKTtgMzlCuXMp8iIiq8iBb)
that hosts some important files we use. It'll be helpful to join that!

### Join our Slack workspace

We have a [Slack workspace](https://ojosproject.slack.com) that we use to
communicate with each other. Please join!

### Send us your email

A lot of the stuff we do will require email addresses. We require that you send
us an email that is associated with your institution. The following are the
currently approved domains:

| Domain                   | Institution                                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@uci.edu`               | [University of California, Irvine](https://uci.edu/)                                |
| `@ics.uci.edu`           | [UCI Donald Bren School of Information and Computer Sciences](https://ics.uci.edu/) |
| `@students.imperial.edu` | [Imperial Valley College](https://imperial.edu/)                                    |

:::note

Don't see you domain? Let Carlos know. It just means we haven't had students
with that domain before. Remember, it has to be from an educational institution.
That is, it must end with `.edu`.

:::

### Send Carlos a website

We promote your website on [our main page](https://ojosproject.org/#team) and on
[the members page](/url/members/). Send Carlos your website to add the link!

:::tip

It doesn't have to be a personal website. Examples we suggest are:

- Portfolio
- Email
- LinkedIn
- ... anything else you may want recruiters to see

:::

### Set up your Gravatar

A lot of the services we use integrate [Gravatar](https://gravatar.com/). It's
important to have one set as it gives an avatar to your name on our website. To
learn more about getting that up, please check out
[this guide](/url/developers/guides/gravatar). All you have to do is create a
Gravatar account and set a photo. That's it!

### Getting recognized as a member

:::tip

If you are enrolled in IN4MATX 199, you will automatically become a recognized
member.

:::

To get recognized as a member, you must contribute to the project in some way.
That may mean writing research notes, adding a commit message to any of our git
repos, etc. As long as we see you are dedicated to the project, you may get
recognized as a member if you so wish. To remain an active member, you must
comply with our [attendance policies](/policies/url-lab-attendance/).

Benefits include...

1. Getting added to [the website](https://ojosproject.org/#team)
2. Getting access to our git repos as a Developer
3. Getting vouched for by Carlos if you need a reference
4. Probably more that I can't think of right now

### What's next?

There may be more instructions depending on the team you're in. Read the
instructions for the team you are in:

- [Developers team](/url/developers/getting-started/)
- [Engineering team](/url/engineering/getting-started/)
