Developers are still learning Rust, now trying with
[Tour of Rust](https://tourofrust.com/).

### Engineering

Eningeering continue to familarize with Onshape User interface and capbailites.
It is showing that there is a long road to develop individual skills.

### Ojos Project

We introduced the team to the [digital agenda on Google Docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10M-nWgvVwltjMFBX2B4WWvXJXEF5i2PFWH1fpbsGK-8/).
We also told the team about the SURP/LAEP winners. Members will also asked to
sign up to the URL Planning Committee if they're interested.

### Developers

Developers are learning Rust and did some demo projects to get the gist of Rust
before writing code for Iris.

### Engineering

Engineering began to create more immediate goals for indiviudals for the summer.
These include:

- Literature reserach on engineering systems
- Imprvement of technical skills
- development of of documentation and Engineering writing.

Additionally, We began to use Onshape Tutorials and implement older project STL
designs in the new system.

### Ojos Project

The Ojos Project collaborated on the previous meeting to decide more about the
workflow, summer undergraduate research program guidelines. Furthermore,
discussion with Mark Baldwin on the events and the performance of the Symposium.

### Engineering

Developments on new systems management for CAD collaboration are being decided.
Tasks and responsibilities for the rest of the qtr as well as summer we also being
discussed. These include roles, hours of meeting, location and remote
possibility.

We also determined summer commitments such as career and academic
responsibilities. Later on, we began looking in the proper licensing for the
hardware design. Prioritizing open-source values, and accreditation of our work
contributions.

### Developers

Developers voted on transitioning the project from Python to Rust and started
learning a bit of Rust.

### Developers

Jason noticed we could make a `.sql` to create the tables faster. We did so, but
we all had to brush up on SQL, specifically with `sqlite3`.

Carlos started using
[GitHub Milestones](https://github.com/ojosproject/iris/milestone/1) to create
agendas for the team.

difficult. Carlos and Jason got started with the code and created various
modules, such as `Database.py`, `User.py`, `main.py`, and `Medications.py`.

### Research Advisor Meeting

We updated the professor about the different designs happening with Developers
and Engineering. He asked us about our workflow and mentioned we seem to be
doing the waterfall method. Once coding starts, we will be switching a different
workflow. We might try agile?

### Developers, Engineering

Everybody worked on the 2024 Symposium poster for the Ojos Project.

Carlos and Joseph are actively adding supplemental content on the website for
the symposium.
[Process can be seen in this PR](https://github.com/ojosproject/website/pull/29).

Jason looked into Pipfiles and wrote some documentation on it for us to use
later.
[Progress can be seen in this PR](https://github.com/ojosproject/website/pull/30).

### Developers

Developers took some time to ensure all of our designs are
consistent with one another. We also created a new
Filesystem Diagram to help us visualize how
Iris will interact with the Linux filesystem.

Developers also continued to work on the Requirements.

We plan on starting development this Friday.

We introduced a new developer! Welcome Mai!

### Engineering

Engineering developed more into the mounting system and adjusted previous models
now that we have parts to use and measure from.

### Developers

Developers decided to work on the
Iris database scheme since working on
class diagrams became complicated without having a solid idea of what exactly
the database will have. The database schema is mostly finalized.

Carlos took time to research how to implement Patient
Reported Outcomes (PROs) into the database and decided to use
[PROMIS](https://www.healthmeasures.net/explore-measurement-systems/promis).

Ayush and Jason worked on creating a dummy database to see how effective our
schema is.

Carlos and Jesse worked on a flowchart diagram for the Symposium.

### Engineering

While Joseph and Meadow continue on the CAD modeling of the Palliaview, Kris
highlighted key problems that we needed to address in the mounting system.

Additionally, parts were able to be purchased with an estimated arrival of
May 1, 2024. Any additional parts such as fastener and thread inserts are still
need for purchase.

The following are still underway.

- [ ] Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
- [ ] Computer-Aided Drawings (CAD)
- [ ] Electrical Diagrams
- [ ] Engineering Reports

### Research Advisor Meeting

Engineering requested things to be bought for the prototype. The professor
bought the required hardware during the meeting.

Developers explained the prototype we're trying to program, which is a text
notification every time a medication is logged. We also explained that the
open-source accessibility tools we're looking into are either not updated
anymore or require more research.

We spoke about the Symposium and the abstract we wrote. We don't need to add
the open-source tools we're using in the abstract, though it's a good idea to
mention them in our poster, potentially with a QR code. We also clarified that
we're using the open-source AAC tools, and improving upon those tools is not the
focus of this project; therefore, it's not needed to add it in the abstract.

:::note

The website has a `/qr/` path we should use to ensure there's no broken links.
[Check the GitHub repository for how it works](https://github.com/ojosproject/website/blob/main/src/pages/qr.tsx).

### Developers

Developers continued to work on C4 models. We near finalized the component
diagram, though they're going to look into it more. We also started working on
class diagrams and noticed the diagrams became a bit too messy. We're going to
work on a SQL schema before continuing with the class diagrams.

We will also start a new iteration of the requirements.

### Engineering

The Engineers continues with our digital modeling of the first prototype.
Additionally, we managed to classify our kiosk name to work in tandem with our
IRIS Software. For now the Kiosk will now be name the Palliaview.

Furthermore, We began to make a checklist of future reports and illustrations
needed to be produced:

- [ ] Finite Element Analysis (FEA)
- [ ] Computer-Aided Drawings (CAD)
- [ ] Electrical Diagrams
- [ ] Engineering Reports

### Developers

The Developers worked on the C4 Model more, creating a rough draft of the
Container Diagram and the Component Diagram, both of which will be found in the
C4 Model page.

The Developers have also agreed to develop a mobile app for Iris written in
[React Native](https://reactnative.dev/) to keep only one extra codebase. This
app would be available for iOS, Android, and the Web. It is currently codenamed
"Iris Lite" and is meant to be a read-only version of the Iris data.

The Developers have agreed to meet on Fridays from 12 PM - 4 PM to ensure we
have prototype software for the Symposium.

We have a checklist we have to get done before the Symposium:

- [ ] Finish C4 Model
- [ ] Figma prototypes
- [ ] Learn... (we may decide to choose a different language)
  - [ ] Rust
  - [ ] GNOME ecosystem

### Engineering

Engineering Team has begun the Computer Aided Design Process for two systems for
our Kiosk Device:

- Kiosk Tablet
- Mounting System

Additionally, we have finalized our first shopping list for the prototype we
will be presenting during our [2024 Symposium](/news/symposium-2024/)

## Previous Reports

Before this page, we didn't exactly have "meeting reports". Rather, we just took
attendance in an [internal Google Docs, which you can view here if you have
access](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aNoTci4Yo663LW_om2WUFohHg6SC70SI3AmMp9x4gc8/).
