# Ojos Project Docs

![Ojos Project header](@site/static/images/header.png)

The Ojos Project Docs' goal is to provide you with as much information of the
project as possible in a simple and easy to understand way. Although the project
is relatively young, our documentation is rapidly growing on a near-daily basis.

## Getting Started

There's a lot of different things you can explore. For example...

| Doc                                     | Description                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [Iris Documentation](/docs/iris/)       | Iris is an open-source hospice management system developed by the Ojos Project. |
| Palliaview Documentation (Coming soon!) | Palliaview is our plug-and-play solution for Iris software.                     |
| [Website Documentation](/docs/website/) | `ojosproject.org` has a lot of neat features that are documented.               |

## Need help?

These docs should be simple to understand and constantly updated. If that is not
the case, please contact either [Joseph Sweatt](mailto:jsweatt@uci.edu) for the
Engineering Docs or [Carlos Valdez](mailto:cvaldezh@uci.edu) for everything else
in the docs.

Otherwise, you may raise an issue in our
[GitHub repository](https://github.com/ojosproject/website/issues/new?assignees=calejvaldez&labels=documentation&template=docs.yml&title=⚠%EF%B8%8F+Insert+a+short+title+for+your+issue.).

Thanks!
