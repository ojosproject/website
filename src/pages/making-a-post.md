# Making a news post

Making a news post is easy, but requires coordination between the writers and
the developers.

## Writers: Use your preferred writing app

We prefer Google Docs.
[Create an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/ojosproject/website/issues/new?template=news_post.yml)
and attach the issue number to your work.

Here's a [Google Docs template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PsXjHyawOUAAQnZ54Jc4EkZ_dWkhlxYUSw5E0E-sFlM/).

Deliverables:

- A new GitHub issue you created
- A news post with the template (shared link)
- **If your post includes photos:** Share a folder instead with the photos too

## Developers: Build the page

The developers will read over and type up the post in an acceptable Markdown
format.

Deliverables:

1. A Markdown file of the post
2. The post available on the website
