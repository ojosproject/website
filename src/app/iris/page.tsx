						Iris for Desktop is developed within the Undergraduate Research Lab
						(URL) at UC Irvine as part of Palliaview. Since 2023, students have
						been actively researching existing caregiver technologies,
						interviewing healthcare professionals and family caregivers, and
						iterating on Iris through user interviews and direct feedback.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a research project, Palliaview won three grants from the UCI
						Undergraduate Research Opportunities Program (UROP).

					<p>
						Many of us became caregivers before we were ready. Iris is the tool
						we wish we hadâ€”built by those who once felt helpless, for those who
						still do.
					</p>
					<p>
						We believe care tools should be as accessible as possible. That's
						why Iris for Desktop is fully open-source. Anybody can use it, study
						it, or build upon it.
